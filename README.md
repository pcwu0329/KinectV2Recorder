# KinectV2Recorder
**Authors:** [Po-Chen Wu](http://media.ee.ntu.edu.tw/personal/pcwu/)

KinectV2Recorder is a Win32 program used for recording the **Color**, **Depth**, and **Infrared** sequences captured from Kinect V2. These three different sequences are somehow synchronized in hardware (30 fps). The depth and infrared frames are captured in the exact same time, followed by the color frame (~ 6 ms later).

* **SSD** (for fast image storage)

##### c. Software Requirements
* Visual Studio 2012 or Visual Studio 2013 (or later)
* Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0 ([download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561))
* (Optional) Intel® Integrated Performance Primitives (IPP) ([download](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/free_ipp)) 
* (Optional) Use **RAM Disk** if SSD isn't fast enough ([download](https://www.softperfect.com/products/ramdisk/))

### Program Description
Kinect V2 Recorder is used for recording image sequences at 30 fps (or just take pictures) with Kinect V2. Color images are stored in **PPM** (or **BMP** by *#define COLOR_BMP*) format (24 bits per pixel). Depth and infrared images are stored in **PGM** format (16 bits per pixel). D2D is used to achieve real-time display. Intel IPP is further used in regards to optimization. To enable using IPP, please following the project setup shown below.
